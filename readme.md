Calculate the partitioning of te plane given some parameters (R, epsilon, roughness) and a graph.

## Usage: 


If you are on Ubuntu or another debian-based linux distribution, run `sudo sh setup.sh`, and copy `partitioner.x` from the build directory to the corresponding directory of the main netext installation (`netext/src/geometry/partition/partitioner.x`).
